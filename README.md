# TriState-Buffer-based-FIFO-controller-module
The module incorporates a 125 MHz to 1 Hz clock divider circuit followed by tri-state buffer uenabled Controller module for the FIFO memory block. The design steers the incoming 1 Hz clock from the clock divider module into either read or write pins depending on corresponding enable status, and triggers it off after 1 pulse of the clock has passed,within which the data is read or written into the FIFO module.
